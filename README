CodaPreview
===========

Panic's Coda 2 is rather dumb about how it maps on-disk filenames to preview 
URLs--it basically just turns $LOCAL_ROOT/path into $LOCAL_URL/path.
That doesn't work for Rails.  This plugin installs routes for app/controllers, 
app/views, app/assets/stylesheets, and app/assets/javascripts which attempt to 
redirect you to a reasonable preview page.

To start using this, just drop it into your vendor/plugins folder.

Note
====

I have only done the bare minimum work needed to make this work in my project.
This is not really properly packaged yet, and I don't really know enough about 
Rails plugins to do it properly right now.  Assistance would be greatly 
appreciated.
